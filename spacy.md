## About spaCy
spaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. If you’re working with a lot of text, you’ll eventually want to know more about it. For example, what’s it about? What do the words mean in context? Who is doing what to whom? What companies and products are mentioned? Which texts are similar to each other?

spaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning.

spaCy is not a platform or an API. Unlike a platform, spaCy does not provide a software as a service, or a web application. It’s an open-source library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service. Unlike [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) or [Core NLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) which were designed for teaching and research, spaCy is not research software. This means that spaCy is integrated and opinionated. spaCy avoids asking the user to choose between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. For our purposes in this tutorial, spaCy is useful for exploring features common to NLP without requiring training our own models. 

_Much of the following is adapted from the spaCy Usage documentation. See the references section of this tutorial for links to this and other resources._

## Getting Started

### Python and pip
spaCy is compatible with 64-bit CPython 2.7 / 3.5+ and runs on Unix/Linux, macOS/OS X and Windows. The latest spaCy releases are available over pip and conda. The following installation instructions will use Python and pip. For information on installing and working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [pip  package-management system](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), see these resources:
* [Python Setup and Usage](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)
* [Do I Need to Install pip?](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* On a Mac, simply type `python3` in your terminal. If not already installed, you will be prompted to install "Command Line Tools" via XCode. Agree to installation and you should be all set. 

For more detailed information and varied options see the [spaCy Installation Guide](https://spacy.io/usage#installation)

### Installing spaCy and Downloading Statistical Model (English model)
1. Navigate to the terminal. 
> * To open the terminal in Linux, press Ctrl+Alt+T in Ubuntu, or press Alt+F2, type in gnome-terminal, and press enter. In Raspberry Pi, type in lxterminal
> * To open the terminal in MacOS, either open your Applications folder, then open Utilities and double-click on Terminal, or press Command - spacebar to launch Spotlight and type "Terminal," then double-click the search result.
> * To open the command prompt in Windows, press Windows+R to open “Run” box, then type “cmd” and then click “OK” to open a regular Command Prompt. Type “cmd” and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open an administrator Command Prompt.
2. Install spaCy in a virtual environment by running the following commands.
> * When using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a virtual environment to avoid modifying system state. The first two commands here set up a virtual environment and the third installs spaCy in that environment.
> * Do not copy the `$`. This character signifies the beginning of a command line prompt. So, commit each separate `$` as a separate prompt (i.e. hit return/enter to run each line before moving to the next `$`).

**MacOS/Linux**
```
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -U spacy
```
**MacOS/Linux with Python3 and pip3** 
> If you try the previous commands and nothing returns, try these instead. They go straight to the latest version of python and pip. If these work, remember to add use `python3` and `pip3` for all future commands where you see `python` or `pip`, too!
```
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install spacy
```
**Windows**
```
$ python -m venv .env
$ .env\Scripts\activate
$ pip install spacy
```
3. Download core statistical model by running the following command.
> While some of spaCy’s features work independently, others require statistical models to be loaded, which enable spaCy to predict linguistic annotations.spaCy core models are general-purpose pretrained models to predict named entities, part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependencies, which can be used out-of-the-box and fine-tuned on more specific data.

> As our input will be in English, this is the download for the core English model-- _other models available [here](https://spacy.io/usage/models)_

**MacOS/Linux** 
> Don't forget to use `python3` and `pip3` if that worked for you in Step 2. 
```
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
**Windows**
```
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
## Working with spaCy
### Pre-Processing Text String
The first step for working with spaCy is to pass it to an NLP object. This object is essentially a pipeline of several text pre-processing operations through which the input text string has to go through. The NLP pipeline has multiple components, such as tokenizer, tagger, parser, ner, etc. So, the input text string has to go through all these components before we can work on it.

1. Open a python interactive shell/interpreter by simply typing `python` or `python3` (depending on what worked for you earlier) in your terminal. You should now see `>>>` at the beginning of your prompts. This means you are now running your code in a python shell.

2. Import spaCy and load model installed earlier. This will return a language object, called an NLP, containing all components and data needed to process text.
```
>>> import spacy
>>> nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
```

3. Process a string of text through the nlp to create a `doc` (an object split into individual words and annotated). This tutorial uses sample text, but feel free to use a text string of your choice between the double quotation marks.
```
>>> doc = nlp(“The work we do in the VMW is designed to be as self-reflexive as possible, using agile and iterative approaches to our humanities research in order to refine questions and respond productively to new findings and realizations”)
```

4. Your string of raw text has now been split on whitespace characters, then tokenized (i.e. segmented it into words, punctuation, etc.) according the language rules:
```
>>> for token in doc:
    print(token.text)
```

### Linguistic Annotations
Running our raw text string through spaCy’s processing pipeline results in a variety of linguistic annotations regarding the text’s grammatical structure. After tokenization, spaCy parses and tags the given `doc`. This is where the statistical model comes in, which enables spaCy to make a prediction of which tag or label most likely applies in this context. This includes the word types, like the parts of speech, and how the words are related to each other. Linguistic annotations are available as `token` attributes:
> * Text: The original word text
> * Lemma: The base form of the word
> * POS: The simple UPOS part-of-speech tag
> * Tag: The detailed part-of-speech tag
> * Dep: Syntactic dependency, i.e. the relation between tokens
> * Shape: The word shape – capitalization, punctuation, digits
> * is alpha: Is the token an alpha character?
> * is stop: Is the token part of a stop list, i.e. the most common words of the language?

We can call these annotations the same way we called our tokenized text above with the `print` function, but with one additional note... Like many NLP libraries, spaCy encodes all strings to hash values to reduce memory usage and improve efficiency. To get the readable string representation of an attribute, add an underscore _ to its name. For example:
```
>>> for token in doc:
    print(token.text,  token.pos_, token.dep_)
```

Most of the tags and labels appear to be abstract, and they vary between languages. `spacy.explain` will show you a short description – for example, `spacy.explain("VBZ")` returns “verb, 3rd person singular present”.

### Visualizing Dependencies and Entities

If you plan to use spaCy for development purposes, visualizing dependencies and named entities can be useful for speeding up things like debugging your code and training. In our case, we will use the spaCy’s tool called “displaCy” on our `Doc` to visually demonstrate NLP and what you have accomplished with spaCy.

1. The quickest and most convenient way to visualize any spaCy `Doc` is to use `displacy.serve`. It will let you view results straight in your browser
```
>>> from spacy import displacy
```
2. Let’s try visualizing the dependency parse to show part-ofspeech tags and syntactic dependencies:
```
>>> displacy.serve(doc, style="dep")
```
3. Copy and paste the `http` address into your internet browser to see the results.
